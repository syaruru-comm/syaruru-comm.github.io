However, deploying new network features requires expensive maintenance procedures (e.g., to isolate, reflash, and redeploy network devices), which take careful planning over weeks. Our project aims to accelerate the velocity of network change to a matter of seconds, by developing runtime programmable networks. We envision that the end-to-end network infrastructure, vertically from the host kernels to the NICs, and horizontally extending across switches to the other end of the network, can be reprogrammed on-the-fly without packet loss, and with strong consistency guarantees.

In this design, a switch not only forwards traffic, but also applies to it a wide range of defenses. The network not only routes traffic end-to-end, but also swaps defenses along the paths in and out as needed to mitigate attacks. Attacks with mixed vectors would trigger concurrent defenses, and attacks that rapidly change would be met with equally fast defense swapping. In its full force, the network would toggle a wide array of defenses rapidly on and off as traffic flows through, mitigating attacks in real time.

It must be sufficiently general-purpose in order to support diverse applications and increasingly smarter hardware, but the need for generality often precludes scenario-specific optimization. Our project navigates this tension by developing programmatic specialization to produce more efficient systems. The mechanism for reconfiguration is based upon a match\/action pipeline, and the policies are derived via a data-driven approach or machine learning.

Our project designs abstractions for tracking causal relationships between system states and their changes, and uses them to enable provenance reasoning for end-to-end clarity. This has enabled fault prevention, root cause analysis and repair primitives for misconfigurations, performance issues, correlated failures, and in-network telemetry.
