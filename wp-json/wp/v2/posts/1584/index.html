It must be sufficiently general-purpose in order to support diverse applications and increasingly smarter hardware, but the need for generality often precludes scenario-specific optimization. Our project navigates this tension by developing programmatic specialization to produce more efficient systems. The mechanism for reconfiguration is based upon a match\/action pipeline, and the policies are derived via a data-driven approach or machine learning.
