However, deploying new network features requires expensive maintenance procedures (e.g., to isolate, reflash, and redeploy network devices), which take careful planning over weeks. Our project aims to accelerate the velocity of network change to a matter of seconds, by developing runtime programmable networks. We envision that the end-to-end network infrastructure, vertically from the host kernels to the NICs, and horizontally extending across switches to the other end of the network, can be reprogrammed on-the-fly without packet loss, and with strong consistency guarantees.
