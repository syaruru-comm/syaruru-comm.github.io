However, deploying new network features requires expensive maintenance procedures (e.g., to isolate, reflash, and redeploy network devices), which take careful planning over weeks. Our project aims to accelerate the velocity of network change to a matter of seconds, by developing runtime programmable networks. We envision that the end-to-end network infrastructure, vertically from the host kernels to the NICs, and horizontally extending across switches to the other end of the network, can be reprogrammed on-the-fly without packet loss, and with strong consistency guarantees.

The change of today\u2019s programmable networks requires management operations such as draining and rerouting traffic from the target node, re-imaging the data plane, and redirecting traffic back to its original route. This project investigates design techniques to make future networks runtime programmable. FlexCore enables partial reconfiguration of switch data planes at runtime with minimum resource overheads, without service disruption, while processing packets with consistency guarantees. It involves design considerations in switch architectures, partial reconfiguration primitives, reconfiguration algorithms, as well as consistency guarantees. Our evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of runtime programmable switches on commercial switch silicon and BMv2 switches.
