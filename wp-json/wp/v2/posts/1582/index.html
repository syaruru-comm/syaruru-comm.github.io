In this design, a switch not only forwards traffic, but also applies to it a wide range of defenses. The network not only routes traffic end-to-end, but also swaps defenses along the paths in and out as needed to mitigate attacks. Attacks with mixed vectors would trigger concurrent defenses, and attacks that rapidly change would be met with equally fast defense swapping. In its full force, the network would toggle a wide array of defenses rapidly on and off as traffic flows through, mitigating attacks in real time.
